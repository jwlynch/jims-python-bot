This is, initially, the "that's what she really said" quotebot from
the tutorial at the url in tutURL.txt.

You should be able to run it when in the dir with this readme,

  twistd -n twsrs

Some directions I want to explore: use of sql and orms, maybe combining
the bot with a django site and its orm. also, users (on irc by their hostmask),
commands, and which users get to run what commands, with an object and permission
system inspired by openacs.
